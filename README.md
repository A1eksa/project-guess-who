# Guess who game

Assignment for this week was to create our own digital version of the old board game Guess who.
Some html/css/JavaScript code was already provided. Goal of this week was to manipulate objects, arrays, dom, how to structure JS code and how to break the game into small steps.

## The problem

The biggest problem for me was actual syntax and how to write it but it helped a lot to break everything into small pieces and steps that you othervise dont think about. and consol log (Thank you Elin:))
If i had more time i would play with css and effects but i wanted rather to understand the code and what part does what.
